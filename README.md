# Smart-Bus-Route-Optimization-Using-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
The Bus Route Planning System project aims to use reinforcement learning to optimize passenger pickup and routing in a city setting. An intelligent bus agent is trained to choose the most effective routes and pick up passengers strategically by integrating the principles of reinforcement learning. This paper presents an 
innovative approach to optimize urban bus management systems using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms. We integrate Q-Learning and Deep Q
Learning. Deep Reinforcement Learning emphasizes the critical role of value functions in enhancing passenger pickup efficiency, route planning, and multi-agent 
coordination. These functions help our bus agents navigate the complex network of city streets. They enable the agents to make smart choices that pick up more 
passengers and make travel times as efficient as possible. Our findings offer transformative insights into the application of DRL for urban mobility and bus 
management system optimization.
